# DQFD_TensorFlow_2
Double Deep Q Learning for Demonstrations (Implemented in tf 2)

Requirements:
1. Tensorflow 2.x
2. OpenAI Gym (Implemented for Lunar Lander as a sample)

Additional requirements:
3. Tensorboard(for visualization)

Pre-generated demonstrations are loaded into the memory. If you want to try this on your own custom environment, save the demonstrations in a npy format file replace the demos.npy file.
